                   <p class="p1">Let's kick it off with the famous <strong>poutine</strong> which is a peppery meat-based gravy and “squeaky” curds on fries. You can get this dish in any Canadian disher with fries on the menu, including big chains like <em>Rotten Ronnie's</em> (McDonald's)</p>

                   <p class="p1">A really popular dessert is the <strong>Nanaimo Bars</strong>. The distinctive feature of the original Nanaimo bars is its pale yellow custard center, which is encircled by a coconut and nut wafer base and is topped with a layer of chocolate ganache. But many renditions of this well-known delicacy have been made, including ones with peanut butter, pistachio, mint, and other ingredients.</p>

                   <p class="p1">Here's a dish with a long history in French Canada that dates back to the 1600s. According to legend, the baking pan the flakey pie is made in gave rise to its name. Although in certain coastaal areas ground fish is used, <strong>tourtière</strong> is commonly filled with ground pork, beef, veal or game and a sprinkle of herbs and spices. Although Quebec grocery shops carry it year-round, Christmas and New Year's are the two most popular times to have the hefty feast.</p>

                   <p class="p1">The question of whether raisins should be included in the batter for this cake, which has a delicate, crumbly crust and a creamy centre formed of a butter, sugar, and egg combination, is frequently disputed. The majority of coffee shops and bakeries have them, but if you're serious about this delicious delicacy, it's worth travelling to Ontario, which is where the <strong>butter tart</strong> originated.</p>
