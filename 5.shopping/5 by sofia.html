            <p>Fortunately, there are many uniquely Canadian items available for purchase while on vacation in Canada, whether it's something for yourself or a present to bring back for your family and friends.</p>

            <h3 style="background-color:colar;">Maple Syrup</h3>
            <section class="p1">
              <p>A gift of maple syrup is ideal for a gourmet because it is connected with Canada. This unadulterated, 100 percent natural product has withstood the test of time without losing a shred of its organic beauty and is currently sold to more than 50 nations worldwide.</p> 
                        
              <p>The Toronto-based, modest, and maple-obsessed business Drip Maple is a terrific way to get maple syrup.</p> 
                        
              <p>Customers may purchase Drip Maple Syrup's 100% pure Canadian maple syrup, which is sourced from a single forest in Northern Ontario. Drip Maple is available in three varieties: blonde, copper, and amber, and the maple syrup is unblended.</p>
                        
              <p><strong>Blonde</strong>: This exquisite syrup is produced from early-season sap, and the classic maple flavour is mixed with warm vanilla to create a chorus of traditional, complementary flavours. Almost everything may be treated with this syrup.</p> 
                        
              <p><strong>Copper</strong>: Things become more serious when it comes to maple syrup with Drip Copper, and if you're just a casual syrup fan, this is probably the best option for you. It is ideal for desserts, salads, and pancakes since it combines a decadent caramel flavour with a full-bodied maple package.</p> 
                        
              <p><strong>Amber</strong>: This rich, long-lasting maple flavour, which is not for the faint of heart, dances over the tongue with complexity for eaters. Use this syrup to glaze Belgian waffles.</p>

            <h3>Aboriginal art</h3>
            <section class="p1">        
                <p>There are many works of Aboriginal art available for purchase if you're an art fan.</p> 
                        
                   <p>Although the earliest surviving pieces of art may be dated to roughly 5,000 years ago, indigenous (Aboriginal) art in Canada has a history that goes back to the last Ice Age, between 80,000 and 12,000 years ago.</p>
                          
                   <p>If purchasing the original Aboriginal art is out of your price range (unless you have a million or more to spare), there are several reproductions available for purchase. Additionally, a large number of First Nations Canadians are creating new work that is influenced by their culture.</p>
                        
                   <p>The Museum of Anthropology has a fantastic collection of Aboriginal art, and there are many replicas available for purchase in its stores that would make wonderful gifts.</p>

            <h3>Wool blanket</h3>
             <section class="p1">         
                <p>The Northern Lights, husky rides, ice skating, snowshoeing, and the best woollens for cuddling come as benefits of Canada's frigid winters.</p> 
                        
                 <p>Woolrich, a company that makes outdoor apparel, is an excellent site to get wool blankets if you want something that is of the highest calibre.</p>
                        
                 <p>The Hudson's Bay 8-Point Wool Blanket is a highly popular memento, and Woolrich has outlets all over Canada, including in Vancouver. These ancient blankets may have been sent to Canada from England, but they have been in use there since 1779 and were formerly exchanged for money by trappers and Native Americans.</p>
                        
                 <p>One can easily see how pleasant it would be to cuddle up in at home with the 8-Point Hudson Bay wool blanket, which fits a typical king-size bed.</p>

        <article>             
          <h4>Yorkville, Toronto, Ontario</h4>
          <img src="shopping 1.jpg" class="shopping">
                        
              <p class="p2">Yorkville, a calm suburb with narrow streets shielded from the commotion of downtown Toronto, is regarded as Canada's most exclusive retail area. Some of the biggest brands in fashion and design call these streets home, including Burberry, Prada, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., etc. Store rent here is an outrageous $300 per square foot. You should carry multiple credit cards if you want to purchase here.</p>
                        
          <h4>West Edmonton Mall, Edmonton, Alta</h4>
          <img src="shopping 2.jpg" class="shopping">
                        
              <p class="p2">Since it has over 800 shops and services, West Edmonton Mall continues to be a must-visit location for serious shoppers even if it lost the title of biggest mall in the world back in 2004. It takes up an incredible six million square feet of commercial space. A full-fledged amusement park with the tallest and longest indoor roller coasters in the world, a five-acre water park, an ice palace, mini golf, and many other entertaining activities make it a wonderful location for individuals who take partying seriously.</p>
                        
          <h4>Byward Market, Ottawa, Ontario</h4>
          <img src="shopping 3.jpg" class="shopping">
                        
              <p class="p2">One of Canada's oldest and biggest farmers' markets, the By-Ward is located in the nation's capital, just a short distance from the Parliament Buildings. On hot summer weekends, sellers line the streets around the main market structure and draw up to 50,000 customers to buy anything from flowers to jewellery to BeaverTails (flat donuts). Aside from the National Gallery of Canada, the neighbourhood is also home to Ottawa's oldest church, Canada's oldest bar, and more than 100 eateries.</p>
                        
          <h4>The Forks, Winnipeg, Man</h4>
          <img src="shopping 4.jpg" class="shopping">
                        
              <p class="p2">More than six millennia have passed since Aboriginal people first used this location, which is where the Red and Assiniboine rivers meet, as a handy area for trade. It brought hunters, merchants, and dealers together in colonial times. Millions of chic Winnipeggers and tourists from throughout the nation visit it every year. You may readily become captivated by its amazing interior marketplace as it is home to promenades and river walks, theatres, galleries, and numerous top-notch restaurants.</p>
                        
          <h4>Old Quebec City, Quebec City, Quebec</h4>
          <img src="shopping 5.jpg" class="shopping">
                        
              <p class="p2">Old Quebec City has the best vibe of anywhere, in my opinion. You are effectively taken to another place and time as you enter one of North America's oldest cities and walk through its majestic gates. Old Quebec, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and commonly referred to as "Europe without the jetlag," offers Continental fashions, Inuit art, back alleys lined with charming cityscape sketches by local artists, a tightly packed street of charming, atmospheric boutiques, and the legendary Simons department store that first opened its doors in 1840.</p>
